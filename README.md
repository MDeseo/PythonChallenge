# PythonChallenge
Assignment3

This Assignment3 was created using conda verion 4.13.0 in "PythonData" environment.

There are two challenges in this assignment: 
Challenge 1 - 'PyBank'; and 
Challenge 2 - 'PyPoll'

The files are assigned in the respective folders with this name.
Each folder has a Python script called main.py, which is the main script to run the analysis in the respective folders.

Within each folder are two folders: (1) 'Resources' that contains the csv file; and (2) "Analysis' folder that contains the text output of the analysis.


**PyBank Instructions**

Using a Python script, analyse the 'budget_data' csv file and calculate for the following values:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

The analysis should align with the following results:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total Amount: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)


**PyPoll Instructions**

Use the 'election_data' csv file and create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.
 
The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

The analysis should align with the following results:


Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
-------------------------
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
